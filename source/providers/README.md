## Providers

The serverless technology has raised a lot of eyebrows in the community in the last few years and a few big players have stepped up to release their own serverless compute infrastructure platforms. 

The Serverless Framework recognizes the concerns involving provider lock-in and complexity to adopt these platforms. The Serverless Framework provides flexibility for the developer to pick an infrastructure provider of their choosing, develop and deploy applications using it.

### Commercial Hosted Platforms

We will take a look at some popular commercial hosted platforms, namely, **AWS Lambda**, **Microsoft Azure Functions**, **Google Cloud Functions**, and **IBM Cloud Functions** in more detail.

#### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is Amazon's serverless compute offering, announced in 2015. 

> AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

#### Microsoft Azure Functions

Azure Functions is Microsoft's serverless compute offering, announced in spring of 2016.

> Process events with a serverless code architecture. An event-based serverless compute experience to accelerate your development. Scale based on demand and pay only for the resources you consume.

[More details](./azure.md)...

#### Google Cloud Functions

Cloud Functions is Google's serverless compute offering, with Beta announced in spring of 2017.

> A serverless environment to build and connect cloud services. Construct applications from bite-sized business logic billed to the nearest 100 milliseconds, only while your code is running. Serve users from zero to planet-scale, all without managing any infrastructure.

#### IBM Cloud Functions

IBM Cloud Functions is IBM's serverless compute offering, based on Apache OpenWhisk, which launched in early 2016.

> IBM Cloud Functions is an event-driven compute platform that executes application logic in response to events or through direct invocations–from web/mobile apps or other endpoints. The IBM Cloud Functions serverless architecture accelerates development as a set of small, distinct, and independent actions. By abstracting away infrastructure, IBM Cloud Functions frees members of small teams to rapidly work on different pieces of code simultaneously, keeping the overall focus on creating user experiences customers want.

#### Kubeless

Kubeless is an open source project initiated by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com), first introduced in December 2016.

> Kubeless is a Kubernetes native serverless solution. It leverages Kubernetes API primitives to deploy functions within Kubernetes Pods and expose them via Kubernetes services. Functions can be triggered by events or via regular HTTP calls. Monitoring and scaling come from the underlying Kubernetes features.
